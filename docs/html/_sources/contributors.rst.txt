This collection of projects was developed as part of Dr. Dan Kotlyar's Advanced Reactor Physics course at Georgia Tech.
The course material was invaluable in generating the projects along with numerous publications from the reactor physics community.
I am grateful to Dr. Kotlyar for the excellent learning opportunities throughout the semester!
