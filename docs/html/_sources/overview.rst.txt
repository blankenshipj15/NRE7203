Class Overview
================

**Advanced Reactor Physics** explores topics of current interest relevant to advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle analysis. In addition to the theoretical development of the subject, attention is paid to create efficient and clean documentation for the tools used and further developed outside of class.

Through hands on projects, this class develops a deeper understanding of "what's under the hood" when it comes to solving complex engineering design problems in reactor physics.
